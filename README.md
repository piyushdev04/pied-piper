# Pied Piper — Zstd Compression Tool

**Pied Piper** is a minimal file compression and decompression tool powered by Zstandard (Zstd), a modern, ultra-fast lossless compression algorithm developed by Facebook.

Zstd is designed for real-time compression scenarios, offering:
- High compression ratios
- Blazing-fast speeds (both compression and decompression)
- Intelligent optimization for text-heavy and uncompressed files

This tool shows how lossless compression can reduce file size without losing any data. It’s useful for anyone who works with data and wants to save space or speed up transfers.

> Inspired by the *Silicon Valley* show and Richard Hendricks' love for smart and efficient compression.
